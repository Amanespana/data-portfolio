          <p>In today's fast-paced digital age, the opinions expressed on social media can influence public perception, market behavior, and even stock prices. Traders, investors, and analysts are increasingly turning to sentiment analysis to gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

          </p>
        <h3>Why this project?</h3>
        <p>The motivation behind this project stems from the recognition that Twitter users often share their thoughts, feelings, and predictions about stocks and financial markets in real-time. Harnessing the sentiment embedded within these tweets could offer valuable predictive insights and assist in making informed investment decisions.

        </p>
        <h3>Area of Focus</h3>
        <p>In this project, through sentiment analysis, I aim to answer crucial question- <b>Does the collective sentiment on Twitter impact stock prices?</b>
          
           <br>
           <br>
           By embarking on this project, I aspire to bridge the gap between social media (twitter) sentiment and financial markets, ultimately helping investors navigate the complexities of today's interconnected world.
